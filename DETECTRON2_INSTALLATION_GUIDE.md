# Detectron2 Installation Guide for Your Environment

## Current Issue
Your system has a compatibility issue between:
- **CUDA 11.8** (installed)
- **Visual Studio 2022 version 14.41** (too new for CUDA 11.8)
- **PyTorch 2.5.1+cu118** (requires detectron2 compatibility)

The error "unsupported Microsoft Visual Studio version" occurs because CUDA 11.8 only supports Visual Studio 2017-2022 versions up to 14.29, but you have 14.41.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use CPU-Only Training (Immediate)
```bash
# Install CPU-only detectron2 (no CUDA compilation needed)
pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git' --no-deps

# Then install missing dependencies
pip install opencv-python pycocotools
```

### Option 2: Downgrade Build Tools (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 (compatible with CUDA 11.8)
# Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/
# Select "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019"

# After installation, retry detectron2 compilation
cd detectron2
python -m pip install -e .
```

### Option 3: Upgrade CUDA (Advanced)
```bash
# Uninstall CUDA 11.8
# Install CUDA 12.x which supports VS 2022 v14.41
# Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA 12.x
# Then install detectron2
```

### Option 4: Use Pre-built Wheels (If Available)
```bash
# Try finding compatible pre-built wheels
pip install detectron2 -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/index.html
```

## Testing Installation
After any installation approach, test with:
```python
import detectron2
from detectron2.config import get_cfg
print("✓ Detectron2 installed successfully!")
```

## Alternative: Train Without Detectron2
Your enhanced multitask ReLA model can potentially be adapted to work with:
- **torchvision** (for basic computer vision operations)
- **timm** (for model architectures)
- **Custom implementations** (of the required functionality)

Would you like me to:
1. Try Option 1 (CPU-only) for immediate testing?
2. Help adapt the training code to work without detectron2?
3. Wait for you to resolve the Visual Studio compatibility issue?

## Current Status
- ✓ Enhanced multitask model architecture (completed)
- ✓ Training configuration files (completed)
- ✓ Training scripts (completed)
- ❌ Detectron2 installation (blocked by VS/CUDA compatibility)

The model and training pipeline are ready - we just need to resolve the detectron2 dependency.
