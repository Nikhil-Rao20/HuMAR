# 📓 Notebook Training - Setup Complete & Next Steps

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Notebook Structure Created**: `main.ipynb` has 12+ cells for complete training pipeline
2. **Detectron2 Installed**: Successfully installed detectron2 from local folder
3. **Training Script Running**: `train_simple_multitask_2.py` is currently running in terminal with full monitoring

## 🔧 Notebook Setup Status

### ✅ Completed:
- Cell 1: Title and introduction
- Cell 2: Setup environment (paths configured)
- Cell 3: Basic imports (PyTorch, numpy, matplotlib) - **WORKING**
- Cell 4: Install detectron2 - **COMPLETED**

### ⚠️ Next Steps for Notebook:
**IMPORTANT**: After running the installation cell, you MUST **restart the kernel** before continuing!

**To Restart Kernel:**
1. Click the kernel picker at top right of notebook
2. Select "Restart"
3. OR use Command Palette: `Jupyter: Restart Kernel`

**After Restart:**
1. Re-run cell 3 (Setup Environment and Imports)
2. Continue with cell 6 (Import Detectron2) - should now work!
3. Continue through all cells sequentially

## 🚀 Current Training Status

The training script `train_simple_multitask_2.py` is **currently running in a terminal** with all the enhanced monitoring features:

### Features Active:
✅ Real-time TQDM progress bar
✅ CSV logging with timestamps  
✅ 4-panel training visualizations
✅ Detailed progress every 5 iterations
✅ Checkpoint saving

### To Monitor:
- Check the terminal output for progress
- Look in `output/humar_gref_training/` for:
  - `training_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` - metrics log
  - `training_plot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png` - training plots
  - Checkpoint files (`model_*.pth`)

## 📋 Two Ways to Train

### Option 1: Terminal Script (Currently Running)
```powershell
$env:TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS="0"
python train_simple_multitask_2.py --config-file configs/humar_gref_training.yaml --num-gpus 1
```

**Advantages:**
- Stable and tested
- All monitoring features work
- No kernel/import issues

### Option 2: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended After Kernel Restart)
Use `main.ipynb` for:
- Cell-by-cell execution
- Interactive debugging
- Immediate variable inspection
- Better visualization control

**Steps:**
1. Restart kernel (see above)
2. Run cells 1-3
3. Skip cell 4 (detectron2 already installed)
4. Continue with cells 6-12

## 🎯 Model Summary Feature

I've added a model summary feature in the trainer class. After building the model, it will print:
```
---------------------------✅ Multi Task Model built successfully--------------------------------------
```

To add more detailed model summary, you can add this to cell 9 (Build Trainer) after creating the trainer:

```python
# Optional: Print model summary
if hasattr(trainer, 'model'):
    print("\n📊 Model Summary:")
    print("="*70)
    
    # Count parameters
    total_params = sum(p.numel() for p in trainer.model.parameters())
    trainable_params = sum(p.numel() for p in trainer.model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)
    
    print(f"Total Parameters: {total_params:,}")
    print(f"Trainable Parameters: {trainable_params:,}")
    print(f"Non-trainable Parameters: {total_params - trainable_params:,}")
    
    print("\n🏗️  Model Architecture:")
    print(trainer.model)
    print("="*70)
```

## 📈 Monitoring Training

### Real-time Monitoring:
1. **Terminal Output**: Watch the progress bar and iteration logs
2. **CSV Logs**: Open in Excel/pandas while training:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('output/humar_gref_training/training_log_*.csv')
   df.tail()  # See latest iterations
   ```
3. **Training Plots**: Refresh the PNG files to see updated graphs

### In Notebook (After Restart):
- Run cells 1-12 sequentially
- Cell 10 starts training
- Cell 11 shows final results
- Cell 12 analyzes all metrics

## 🎮 GPU Status
✅ CUDA Available: True
✅ GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU  
✅ PyTorch Version: 2.5.1+cu118

## 📝 Key Configuration
- **Max Iterations**: 30
- **Batch Size**: 8
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0001
- **Evaluation Every**: 5 iterations
- **Checkpoint Every**: 10 iterations

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Notebook Imports Fail:
1. **Restart Kernel** (most common solution)
2. Verify detectron2 installed: `!pip list | grep detectron2`
3. Check Python path in cell 3 output

### If Training is Slow:
- Check GPU utilization: `nvidia-smi` in terminal
- Reduce batch size if OOM errors occur
- Monitor CPU fallback warnings

### If Progress Bar Freezes:
- This is normal for first iteration (model loading)
- Check console output for detailed progress
- CSV logs continue even if progress bar freezes

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know training is working when you see:
1. ✅ Progress bar updating with iteration count
2. ✅ Console output every 5 iterations
3. ✅ CSV file growing in size
4. ✅ Training plots being updated
5. ✅ Checkpoint files being saved

## 📞 Next Actions

**Immediate:**
1. Check terminal for training progress
2. Monitor `output/humar_gref_training/` folder

**For Notebook:**
1. Restart kernel
2. Re-run from cell 3 onwards
3. Continue to cell 10 to start training

**After Training:**
1. Run cells 11-12 for analysis
2. Check final plots and metrics
3. Review CSV logs for detailed insights
